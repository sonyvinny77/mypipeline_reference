WE ARE FORGETTING TO INSTALL DOCKER IN JENKINS SERVER
AFTER GIVING PERMISSIONS TO JENKINS TO RUN DOCKER COMMANDS WE SHOULD RESTART THE JENKINS
JENKINS DEFAULT BEHAVIOUR IS IT ALWAYS PICKS FOR MASTER SO IF WE ARE USING MAIN WE SHOULD MENTION IT IN SHARED LIBRARY AS git branch: 'main'
IN SHARED LIBRARY WE SHOULD MENTION EVERY FUNCTION IN DOUBLE QUOTES EXAMPLE: "docker build -t ${imageName} ."
